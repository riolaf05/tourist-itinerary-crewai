# Intro 


The project involves developing a **travel planning assistant powered by a large language model (LLM)** that suggests personalized itineraries and points of interest. The system integrates web search to gather real-time travel information and recommendations. Additionally, it employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) over a vector database to enhance the LLM's responses with relevant, context-aware data. Users receive dynamic, accurate travel suggestions tailored to their preferences and current trends, improving their travel experience.
